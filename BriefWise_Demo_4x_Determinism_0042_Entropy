## ⚙️ Output: Run 1 of 4

Plaintiff should oppose summary judgment by invoking Pennsylvania’s frequency, regularity, and proximity test, which governs asbestos causation challenges at the summary judgment stage. In *Eckenrod v. GAF Corp.*, 544 A.2d 50 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1988), the Superior Court held that a defendant may be held liable where a plaintiff establishes that he was frequently and regularly present within proximity to asbestos-containing products linked to that defendant.

In this case, the Plaintiff provides fact-specific exposure evidence:
- 100+ direct exposures involving Ficticional Defendnat-branded pumps,
- Each associated with maintenance involving asbestos-containing components,
- Dust was visible and inhaled during removal or replacement of gaskets, valves, and packing,
- All occurring at Bethlehem Steel between 1970–1975, during the peak asbestos-use era.

Under *Gregg v. V-J Auto Parts, Co.*, 943 A.2d 216 (Pa. 2007), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court emphasized that summary judgment is inappropriate where exposure evidence creates a reasonable inference that asbestos from a defendant’s product was a substantial factor in causing disease, particularly in mesothelioma cases where latency and cumulative exposure matter.

In *Howard v. A.W. Chesterton Co.*, 78 A.3d 605 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2013), summary judgment was reversed despite lack of quantitative dose evidence because the plaintiff testified to repeated inhalation of asbestos dust in occupational settings directly involving the defendant’s products.

Here, the Plaintiff meets and exceeds that evidentiary threshold. The specificity of the worksite, product ID, and exposure mechanics raises a genuine dispute of material fact. Summary judgment should be denied.
